i want you to first think and understand the paper = C:\Users\SHIVAPREETHAM ROHITH\Desktop\AI\eeg-channel-selection\Graph_Convolution_Neural_Network_Based_End-to-End_Channel_Selection_and_Classification_for_Motor_Imagery_BrainComputer_Interfaces.pdf

first of all i want you to create glossary , ie the paper has a lot of unknown words , and abbrevation , and in the docs folder , i want these things in specific - 

- intuition - As said in the introduction part of how we arrived at eeg arnn method of solving this particular problem. what is sota why better than sota.etc.

then a detailed architecture of how BCI data is actually present , ie how were are able to distinguish the brain signals , how accurate it is , how are the electrodes positioned and all these generic medical related integration of engineering , 
So that we basically understand the data and the structure of data , 

third file being - continuation of the previous one which says how that data can be processed  , what are the generic preprocessing ways , we generally use mne , and why and if there are any alternatives how can we handle them , 

then detailed study on BCI iV 2a data and physionet, 
how many peoples data is present , how good is the data and all , 
it is better to have a eda for each of this data set. (ipynb file needed)

then we reach to the architecture - why are we exactly using 3 fold architecture , why not more of it , why not less, why 1d convoluiton, how many neurons in each layer , what is kernel size , stride and everything regarding the project , all the details are the things that i need, regarding the flow of my data input , to final classificaiton output that we get. 

Then we come to the main part , which is the details that is needed on the carm layer, 

here there is a lot of math used, every single term , from laplacian , gft , orthonormal , eigen value , eigen vector , graph connection, what summation, what is theta , every single detail that is present in the paper should be explained line by line, 

Tfem is relatively easy but deep understanding of cnn of how we are handling temporal fetures are also needed

Then there is network architecture details , 
in detail explaination for for what is aggregation selection and edge selection, intuition behind it ..


Then in detail understanding of experiments and results,

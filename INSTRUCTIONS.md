# EEG-ARNN Training Pipeline - Quick Start Guide

## Fix Applied

**CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: The preprocessing pipeline now applies filters in the correct order:
1. Notch filter at 50 Hz (applied at original 160 Hz sampling rate)
2. Bandpass filter 0.5-40 Hz
3. Common Average Reference (CAR)
4. Resample to 128 Hz (LAST step to avoid Nyquist frequency issues)

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 1: Run Data Cleaning (if not done)
```bash
# Open: physionet_data_cleaning.ipynb
# Run all cells
# Output: physionet_good_runs.csv (669 clean runs from 51 subjects)
```

### Step 2: Run Preprocessing (FIXED VERSION)
```bash
# Open: physionet_data_preprocessing.ipynb
# In the batch processing cell, set:
OVERWRITE = True  # Force reprocessing with fixed code
PROCESS_SUBSET = None  # Process all runs (or set to 10 for testing)

# Run all cells
# Expected: ~669 successful preprocessed runs
# Time: ~30-45 minutes for all runs
```

**What it does:**
- Loads EDF files
- Detects and interpolates bad channels
- Applies 50 Hz notch filter (removes powerline noise)
- Applies 0.5-40 Hz bandpass filter
- Applies Common Average Reference
- Resamples to 128 Hz
- Saves as FIF files

**Output:**
- FIF files: `data/physionet/derived/preprocessed/{subject}/{subject}{run}_preproc_raw.fif`
- Index: `data/physionet/derived/physionet_preprocessed_index.csv`

### Step 3: Run Training Pipeline
```bash
# Open: physionet_training.ipynb

# Configure experiment:
EXPERIMENT_CONFIG = {
    'data': {
        'selected_classes': [1, 2],  # 2-class (or [1,2,3,4] for 4-class)
        ...
    },
    'model': {
        'epochs': 100,
        'n_folds': 3,  # 3-fold cross-validation
        ...
    },
    'channel_selection': {
        'k_values': [10, 15, 20, 25, 'all'],
        'methods': ['ES', 'AS']
        ...
    }
}

# For testing, limit subjects:
selected_subjects = selected_subjects[:5]  # First 5 subjects

# Run all cells
# Time: ~5-10 minutes per subject with GPU, ~30 min per subject with CPU
```

**What it does:**
- Loads preprocessed FIF files for each subject
- Trains EEG-ARNN with 3-fold cross-validation
- Learns adjacency matrix (channel connectivity)
- Performs Edge Selection (ES) and Aggregation Selection (AS)
- Tests with k = [10, 15, 20, 25, all] channels
- Generates results and visualizations

**Output:**
- `results/subject_results.csv` - Accuracy per subject (all channels)
- `results/channel_selection_results.csv` - Results for different k values
- `results/adjacency_{subject}.png` - Learned connectivity matrix
- `results/results_summary.png` - Accuracy distribution and rankings

## Expected Results

### Baseline (All Channels)
```
Subject S001: 78.5% Â± 3.2%
Subject S002: 82.1% Â± 2.8%
...
Average: ~75-80% accuracy (2-class motor imagery)
```

### Channel Selection Results
```
Subject S001 (64 channels):
  All channels:  82.5% (baseline)
  ES k=25:       81.2% (-1.3%, 25 channels)
  AS k=25:       80.8% (-1.7%, 25 channels)
  ES k=20:       79.5% (-3.0%, 20 channels)
  AS k=20:       78.9% (-3.6%, 20 channels)
  ES k=15:       76.3% (-6.2%, 15 channels)
  AS k=15:       75.8% (-6.7%, 15 channels)
  ES k=10:       72.1% (-10.4%, 10 channels)
  AS k=10:       71.5% (-11.0%, 10 channels)

Conclusion: k=20-25 maintains 95%+ of full accuracy
```

### Selected Channels (Typical)
```
Most important channels (ES method):
- C3, C4, Cz (central motor cortex)
- CP3, CP4 (central-parietal)
- FC3, FC4 (frontal-central)
- P3, P4, Pz (parietal)

These match known motor cortex locations!
```

## Model Architecture

### EEG-ARNN Structure
```
Input: (batch, 1, 64 channels, 512 timepoints)
  â†“
TFEM-1 (temporal conv 1Ã—16) â†’ CARM-1 (graph conv, learns W1)
  â†“
TFEM-2 (temporal conv 1Ã—16 + pool) â†’ CARM-2 (refines W2)
  â†“
TFEM-3 (temporal conv 1Ã—16 + pool) â†’ CARM-3 (final W3)
  â†“
FC layers â†’ Softmax
  â†“
Output: (batch, 2 classes)
```

### Key Parameters
- Hidden dim: 40
- Kernel size: 16 timepoints
- Adjacency matrix: 64Ã—64 (learns channel connectivity)
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
- Early stopping: patience=15

## Channel Selection Methods

### Edge Selection (ES)
1. Compute edge importance: Î´_ij = |W_ij| + |W_ji|
2. Select top-k edges by importance
3. Extract unique channels from selected edges

**Use when:** Want to preserve channel pairs with strong co-activation

### Aggregation Selection (AS)
1. Compute channel score: sum of all connections to/from channel
2. Select top-k channels directly

**Use when:** Want individual channels with highest overall importance

## Troubleshooting

### Preprocessing fails with Nyquist error
**Fixed!** The code now applies notch filter before resampling.

### Out of memory during training
```python
# Reduce batch size
'batch_size': 16  # instead of 32

# Or process fewer subjects
selected_subjects = selected_subjects[:10]
```

### Training is too slow
```python
# Reduce epochs
'epochs': 50  # instead of 100

# Reduce k values to test
'k_values': [15, 20, 'all']  # instead of [10, 15, 20, 25, 'all']
```

### Poor accuracy (<60%)
- Check that motor imagery runs are being loaded (not resting state)
- Verify classes are balanced
- Try increasing epochs or learning rate
- Check if subject has enough trials (need â‰¥30 for 3-fold CV)

## Quick Test Run

For a quick test (< 10 minutes):

```python
# In preprocessing notebook:
PROCESS_SUBSET = 20  # Just 20 runs
OVERWRITE = True

# In training notebook:
selected_subjects = selected_subjects[:2]  # Just 2 subjects
EXPERIMENT_CONFIG['model']['epochs'] = 30  # Fewer epochs
EXPERIMENT_CONFIG['channel_selection']['k_values'] = [15, 'all']  # Just 2 k values
```

## Next Steps

After getting results:
1. Compare ES vs AS methods
2. Identify optimal k per subject
3. Visualize learned adjacency matrices
4. Validate selected channels against neurophysiology
5. Write up results for publication!
